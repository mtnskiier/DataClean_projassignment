# Code Book for University of California Irvine Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

## Processing of data
	* Data is downloaded fnd extracted rom the .zip file provided:
	  (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	* Datasets from the 'test' and 'train' directories are combined
	* Variables are extracted from the merged dataset that are mean or standard deviations 
	  (denoted by mean() or std() in the column name)
	* Parenthesis and dashes are removed from variable names for ease of typing and brevity.
	* Activities and subject numbers are converted to factors for readability
	* Mean values are computed by activity and subject then merged into a single table
	* Data is formatted as tidy "wide" data. The observations are the subjects performing the activity. The variables
	  include all the data collected in that observation and are likely to be all interdependent.
	* Resulting data saved as a .csv file. Retrieve using: read.csv("UCI_summary_dataset.csv")


## Understanding the variables
	* The variable names are composite names. Names are decoded in the provided .zip file in 
	  the 'features_info.txt' file.
	* Parenthesis and dashes are removed for ease of typing and brevity.
	* 'Averaged By' is the name of the observation 
	* Variables included in the summary include:
